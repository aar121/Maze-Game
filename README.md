Inspiration taken for this project and initial ideas for structuring the code, allowing for movement and functionality and importing the maze onto the webpage can be found on these websites:

All code was written locally, on my own device, following a simple guide for creating and displaying a maze game. Originally, the intention was to design multiple levels of the maze game but due to time constraints, I only had time to complete one level. In the future, I would love to design more levels and finish adding sounds and allowing for users to choose different characters.
